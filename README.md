simplecolors
============

simplecolors is designed to access color hex codes useing uniformly named colors.

Install development version from GitHub
---------------------------------------

``` r
devtools::install_github("rjake/simplecolors")
```

Usage
-----

The idea is to have a simpler way of accessing color values that is intuitive and easy to remember. Colors can be called using `sc()` or by using the various palette tools `sc_across()`, `sc_blue()`, etc. To see all available colors use `show_colors()`

The colors follow a pattern of \[saturation\] \[color name\] \[lightness\]
