Description: Using the HLS colorspace model, colors and color palettes can be generated with ease.
    You can build a light-to-dark palette in the same hue by holding the hue and saturation values 
    constant and varying the lightness. Similarly, you can build a nice color palette across hues 
    by holding the light and saturation values constant and varying the hue.
