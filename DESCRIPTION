Authors@R:

           family = "Riley",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: Using the HLS colorspace model, colors and color
    palettes can be generated with ease.  You can build a light-to-dark
    palette in the same hue by holding the hue and saturation values
    constant and varying the lightness. Similarly, you can build a nice
    color palette across hues by holding the light and saturation values
    constant and varying the hue.
